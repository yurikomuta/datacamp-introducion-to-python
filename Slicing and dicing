Slicing and dicing

Selecting single values from a list is just one part of the story. It's also possible to slice your list, which means selecting multiple elements from your list. Use the following syntax:

my_list[start:end]
The start index will be included, while the end index is not.

The code sample below shows an example. A list with "b" and "c", corresponding to indexes 1 and 2, are selected from a list x:

x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
x[1:3]
The elements with index 1 and 2 are included, while the element with index 3 is not.

Instructions
100 XP
Use slicing to create a list, downstairs, that contains the first 6 elements of areas.
Do a similar thing to create a new variable, upstairs, that contains the last 4 elements of areas.
Print both downstairs and upstairs using print().


exercises

# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]

# Use slicing to create downstairs
downstairs = areas[:6]

# Use slicing to create upstairs
upstairs = areas[6 :]

# Print out downstairs and upstairs
print (downstairs)
print (upstairs)

Slicing and dicing (2)
In the video, Hugo first discussed the syntax where you specify both where to begin and end the slice of your list:

my_list[begin:end]
However, it's also possible not to specify these indexes. If you don't specify the begin index, Python figures out that you want to start your slice at the beginning of your list. If you don't specify the end index, the slice will go all the way to the last element of your list. To experiment with this, try the following commands in the IPython Shell:

x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
x[:2]
x[2:]
x[:]

Create downstairs again, as the first 6 elements of areas. This time, simplify the slicing by omitting the begin index.
Create upstairs again, as the last 4 elements of areas. This time, simplify the slicing by omitting the end index.

# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]

# Alternative slicing to create downstairs
downstairs = areas[:6]
# Alternative slicing to create upstairs
upstairs = areas[6 :]
